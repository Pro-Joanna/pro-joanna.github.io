Hi, I'm glad that you stopped by at my site!
My name is Joanna and I recently got an interest in programming, so this is just the begining of my journey. For now, my plan is to learn some basics wtih Phyton, JavaScript and probably some others to. If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out! I speak swedish, english and spanish.
